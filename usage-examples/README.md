# Eventix Usage Examples

This directory contains examples that use the **published** `eventix` crate from crates.io, demonstrating real-world usage as an external dependency.

## Purpose

- Test the published crate works as expected
- Provide examples of using `eventix` in other projects
- Verify the public API is ergonomic and complete

## Running

```powershell
cd usage-examples
cargo run
```

## Note

This directory is excluded from:
- Git version control (`.gitignore`)
- Crates.io publishing (`Cargo.toml` exclude)

This allows you to experiment freely without affecting the main library.
